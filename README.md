 I haven't got time to clean up everything.
 
In my personal opinion, simultaneous inversion for layered anisotropic medium parameters and microseismic location for monitoring is still hard because of local minimum and shear waves dealing.

I hope these codes can work as a basis for forward modeling for microseismic monitoring and comparison of different inversion methods.

By the way, I have developed a radically new algorithm for microseismic inversion, my synthetic tests show a significant improvement of state of the art. Please contact me if you want to know more.
