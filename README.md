 I haven't got time to clean up everything.
 
In my opinion, inversion for synthetic layered anisotropic medium is still hard because of local minimum and shear waves dealing.

I hope these code can work as a basis for forward modeling for microseismic monitoring and comparing for different inversion methods.

By the way, I have developed a radically new algorithm for microseismic inversion, my synthetic tests show a significant improvement of state of the art. Please contact me if you want to know more.
