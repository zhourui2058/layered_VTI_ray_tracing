In my opinion, simultaneous inversion for layered anisotropic medium parameters and microseismic location for monitoring is still hard because of local minimum and shear waves processing.

These codes can work as a basis for forward modeling for microseismic monitoring and comparison of inversion methods.

By the way, I have developed a radically new algorithm for anisotropic microseismic inversion, my synthetic tests show a significant improvement of state of the art. Implementions include new nonlinear constraints. Please contact me if you want to know more.
